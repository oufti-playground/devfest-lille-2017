= Continuous Integration with Jenkins

aka "CI"

== CI: Why ?

[quote, Martin Fowler]
____
Continuous Integration doesnâ€™t get rid of bugs, but it does make them
dramatically easier to find and remove.
____

== CI: What ?

[quote, Martin Fowler - Continuous Integration]
____
Continuous Integration is a software development *practice* where members
of a team integrate their work *frequently*,
usually each person integrates at least daily,
leading to *multiple* integrations per day.
____

== CI: How ?

* Each integration is verified by an *automated* build (including test)
* Integrate code *often*, at least daily, to make integration a *non-event*
* *Continuously* build and integrate, with a *feedback loop*

== Continuous Integration with Jenkins

== CI: Accessing Jenkins

* Access your Jenkins instance:
** link:{jenkins-url}[]
** *Log in*  as the user *`butler`* (password is the same)
** It is the "Legacy UI"

== CI: Jenkins BlueOcean

* Switch to BlueOcean, the new UI
** Direct link: link:{jenkins-url}/blue[]
** _Or_ click on the top button "Open Blue Ocean"

== CI: Creating Project

* Create your 1st Pipeline:
** Stored in *Git*
** Fetch URL from the *Gitserver*
*** Direct link: link:{gitserver-url}/butler/demoapp.git[]
** Add a *User/password* credential (`butler` / `butler`)
** Pipeline is empty (for now): no `Jenkinsfile`

== CI: Fast feedback with Webhooks

* We want *Fast feedback* !
** Pushed code to repository ? Tell Jenkins to build it *now*
* Let's use *Webhook* to the repository
** HTTP request *Gitserver* -> *Jenkins*

== CI: Add a Gogs Webhooks

* From repo. in *Gitserver* -> *Settings* -> *Webhooks*
** Direct link: {gitserver-url}/butler/demoapp/settings/hooks
* Add a *Gogs* webhook:
** Payload URL: link:{jenkins-url}/job/demoapp/build?delay=0[]
** When should this webhook be triggered?: *I need everything*

== CI: Starting with Pipelines

* Pipeline-as-code: We need a `Jenkinsfile`
** *Declarative* or *Scripted* ?

* Where to start ?
** Documentation: link:https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline[]
** Getting Started: link:https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/[]
** Syntax Reference: link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[]

== CI: BlueOcean Pipeline Editor

* Provides the *full* round trip with SCM
* No Pipeline ? Follow the wizard (not Gandalf, fool !)
* Already have a Pipeline ? Edit, commit, run it

* Needs a *compliant* SCM
** Only Github with BO 1.0.1
** Interested ? *Open-Source*: Contribute !

== CI: Use the Pipeline Editor

* Let's *hack*: open the *BlueOcean Pipeline Editor*
** Direct (hidden) URL:
link:{jenkins-url}/blue/organizations/jenkins/pipeline-editor/[]
** Use `CTRL + S` (On Mac: `CMD +S`) to switch to textual version

* The "Legacy" Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator can be useful:
** link:{jenkins-url}/job/demoapp/pipeline-syntax/[]

== CI: Exercise - Your First Pipeline

* Use the BO editor and *Gitserver*
* Create a Pipeline that have a single stage "Hello"
* This stage have 1 step that prints the message "Hello World"
* Copy/Paste this Pipeline in a new file `Jenkinsfile` on the repository root
* A build will kick off immediately:
** link:{jenkins-url}/blue/organizations/jenkins/demoapp/activity[demoapp Activity Dashboard]

== CI: Solution - Your first pipeline

[source,subs="attributes",java]
----
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Hello World !'
      }
    }
  }
}
----

== CI: Exercise - Simple Build Pipeline

* Exercise: Implement a simple build pipeline demoapp
* We want 4 stages, for the 4 Maven goals:
** `clean compile`, `test`, `package`, `verify`
* We need to build on the `maven` agent

== CI: Solution - Simple Build Pipeline

[source,subs="attributes",java]
----
pipeline {
  agent {
    node {
      label 'maven'
    }
  }
  stages {
    stage('Compile') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn compile'
      }
    }
    stage('Unit Tests') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn package'
      }
    }
    stage('Verify') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn verify'
      }
    }
  }
}
----

== CI: Exercise - Artifacts

* We want to simplify to 2 stages, based on Unit Tests definition:
** `Build`: compile, unit test and package the application
** `Verify`: Run Integration Tests

* We also want to *archive* the generated `jar` file
** Only if the build is in sucess

* _Clues_: Keywords `post` + `success` (not in Editor),
and `archiveArtifacts`

      }
    }
  }
  post {
    success {
      archiveArtifacts 'target/demoapp.jar'
    }
  }
}
----

== CI: Exercise - Integration Tests Reports

* We want the integration test reports to be published to Jenkins
** *Better* feedback loop

* If Integration Tests are failing, do NOT fail the build
** Make it *UNSTABLE* instead

* _Clues_:
** Maven flag `-fn` ("Fails Never")
** keyword `junit` (Pipeline keyword)

      }
    }
  }
  post {
    success {
      archiveArtifacts 'target/demoapp.jar'
    }
  }
}
----

== CI: Exercise - All Tests Reports

* We now want *all* test reports published
** *Problem:* how to handle Unit test failure ?

* We also want to archive artifacts if build is
unstable *only* due to the `Verify` stage

* _Clues_: `post` can be used per stage

    success {
      archiveArtifacts 'target/demoapp.jar'
    }
  }
}

== CI: Failing Tests

* Validate your changes by making your tests fails.
* Edit each one and uncomment the failing block:
** Integration: `src/master/src/test/java/hello/ApplicationIT.java`
** Unit Tests: `src/master/src/test/java/hello/ApplicationTest.java`

* Browse the top-level items "Changes", "Tests" and "Artifacts"
* Do *NOT* forget to correct your tests at the end

== That's all folks !
